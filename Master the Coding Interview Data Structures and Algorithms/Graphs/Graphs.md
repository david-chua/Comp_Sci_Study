## Graphs

Set of value that are related in a pair-wise fashion.

Each item is called a node or vertex.
Nodes are connected with edges.

Graphs are great data structures for representing relationships.

Graphs encompass Trees and Linked List.

## Types of Graphs

* Directed - You can only go in one direction (Facebook)
* Undirected - One way street. (Twitter)

* Weighted Graphs - You can get the shortest path when you calculate optimal number.
* Unweighted Graphs

* Cyclic - Going from starting node to somewhere else and back to starting. (Like a circle)
* Acycling - Not a full circle.
