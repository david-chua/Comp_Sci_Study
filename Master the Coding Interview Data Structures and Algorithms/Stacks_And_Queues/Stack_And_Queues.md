# Stacks and Queues

## Stacks
Think of stacks as plates that get added on top of each other.
LIFO - Last in, first out

Time Complexity:
* Lookup: O(n)
* Pop: O(1)
* Push O(1)
* Peek O(1)

## Queues

Time Complexity:
* Lookup - O(n)
* Enqueue - O(1)
* Dequeue - O(1)
* Peek - O(1)

examples:
printing in a network, first person prints first, second person prints next.

Why use Arrays over Linked Lists


// Queues
// Arrays - If in array, you'll have to shift the indexes.
// Linked Lists
