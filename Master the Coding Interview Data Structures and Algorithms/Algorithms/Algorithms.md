# Algorithms

Algorithms are just steps to perform a desired process.

Algorithms allow us to data structures

* Sorting
* Dynamic Programming
* BFS + DFS (Searching)
* Recursion

By learning the listed algorithms, we can look into scaling and how to improve our programs.

Certain algorithms allow us to simplify time complexity.

## Recursion Introduction

Recursion is a function that refers to itself.

````
function inception(){
  inception();
};
````

Recursion is really good when there's a repeated subtask

You can use it to traverse a tree.

## Stack Overflow

Difficult to understand at first.

Stack overflow - A function calls itself longer than the stack size. function calls stacking on top of each other without anything being removed in the stack until memory limit is reached or a program limit is reached. This can cause programs to crash due to running out of memory.
