## Data Structures Introduction:

* Knowing the fundamental data structures allows you to be a great developer/engineer.

## What is a Data Structure?

* A data structure is a collection of values.
* Each one is different and can have a different way to use it.
* Think of Data structure as a compartment (drawer, box, folder, etc) - Each one specializes in different things.
* Data structures have a specific way in which it's optimize for a specific use.
* We can put things in a data structure or remove it.
* Everything has a trade off.
* One data structure is better at one aspect than the other.

Two ways to understand data structures:
1. How to Build One
2. How to use it -> When should you use it.

Goal is to understand data structure to pick the correct one in order to solve a problem in the most optimize way.

## How Computer Stores Data:

* Variables are stored in RAM.
* Files are stored in storage. Data storage is persistent.

In RAM, computer loses data if it resets. Why not just use Storage? Persistent data is slow.

Computer parts:
* CPU
* RAM
* Storage

A bit is a electrical switch that can turn on or off (0 or 1)
Memory controller does allocation

CPU asks RAM what's in the specific address by using memory controller.

In Data Structures, storing variables requires memory allocation.

In JavaScript, there are limits on how big a number can get, example Math.pow(6,1000) --> Infinity

System allocates storage.
A data structure is an arrangement of data and how to interact with this data.
Goal is to minimize operation to get/write data.

## Data Structures In Different Languages:

Each language has their own data types.
JavaScript contains: numbers, strings, boolean, undefined, null.
There is also arrays, and objects that allows to hold primitive data types.

## Operations on Data Structures:

* Insertion - Addition of new data
* Deletion - Removing data
* Traversal - Accessing each data once
* Searching - Look up item if it exist
* Sorting - Arrange data in a specific way
* Access - How to access data

Different data structures are good for specific operations.
