Dynamic Programming is an optimization technique

If you have something you can cache, you can use Dynamic Programming.

Dynamic programming is way to solve sub problems by breaking it down into smaller sub problems and storing that data
to use.

Memoization ~~~ Caching
- Way to store values later on in order to use.


When to use Memoization/caching:

1) Can be subdivided into subproblems
2) Recursive solutions
3) Are there repetitive subproblems?
4) Memoize subproblems
5) Demand a raise from your boss


Dynamic Programming Summary:

- Dynamic programming can be use the five steps above to simplify the solution by using caching.
- Memoization is a common strategy
- One other way is
