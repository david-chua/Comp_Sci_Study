# TypeScript & Flow

Type-aware linting.

There is not a one size fits all. Even with respect to that decision, team should decide democratically. --> Style guide.

Benefits of Typescript and Flow:
* Catch type-related mistake
* Communicate type intent -> typing is in the code.
* Provide IDE feedback


Caveats
* Inferencing is best guess, not a guarantee
* Annotations are optional. Dev not putting it, is optional. Can lead to false sense of security
* Any part of the application taht isn't type introduces uncertainty.
