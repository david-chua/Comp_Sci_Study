What are design fundamentals

Example question: design Uber
It's your job as the interviewee to take this into a 45 min discussion
- involves questions
- what type of system your building
- what functionality it supports
- what characteristics to value
- This type of investigation requires fundamental system design knowledge.

Unlike coding interviews where a solution to an interview question is either correct or incorrect. With systems design interview question, there's more subjectivity.

- It's your job why your proposed solution is reasonable.
- Why it's the best solution or why it's one of the best
- Your job to defend your position to adapt your position if interviewer challenges it.
- It's impossible to do without proper knowledge of systems design interviews.

What are design fundamentals?

- Design fundamentals come in a lot of flavors but can be bucketed in 4 categories that can build upon each other

1. Underlying or foundational knowledge
- Without understanding, at best, you have gap to defend position.
- At worst, you won't have the ability to tackle designs interviews
- eg. Client - Server model
- eg. Network protocols - need to know how machines communicate

2. Key characteristics of Systems
- Things you want the systems to have
- Things you can trade off when designing systems
- eg: throughput, availability, latency, redundancy, consistency
- key characteristics of systems that you need to know about.

3. Actual Components of a systems
- more tangible teams
- load balancers
- Proxies
- caches
- rate-limiting
- leader election
- key components that allow your systems to have the key characteristics.

4. Existing tech
- components in a systems
- real tools
- Nginx
- google storage
- zookeeper
- Redis
- Amazon S3
- use to build the system.

The fourth category is one that is often overlook that can round you off and make you shine in interview.

Knowing the 4 categories allows you help improve in the systems design process.
